# Built Environment Data

Data is out there! But in addition to the data, we have have to the metadata. Depending on the metadata format and the study details, that can take some doing. In this project, I gather the metadata association with datasets that I see as an asset in the quest to understand the microbiome of the built environment through the lens of pre-exising data.

For those looking for a nice-to-read summary of what data we have available, check out:

The processing and analysis for the Chicago Hospital data set has grown and moved to its own repository:

For those involved with the effort, many of the larger files are in google drive folder, "PreMiEr_DA_LitReview".
