# Built Environment Data

Data is out there! But in addition to the data, we have have to the metadata. Depending on the metadata format and the study details, that can take some doing. In this project, I gather the metadata association with datasets that I see as an asset in the quest to understand the micribiome of the built environtment through the lens of pre-exisint data.
